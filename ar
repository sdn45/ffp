Data Analysis:

All the fraud transaction done in “transfer” and “cash_out” type so i eliminate other type transaction in dataset to reduce complexity of dataset and reduce computational power.

All “isFlaggedFraud” =1 is also “isFraud” =1 so we can remove “isFlaggedFraud” feature as well.

So, our target data is “isFraud” feature.There is highly imbalanced data in classification of isFraud.
“isFraud”=1 : 0.13%    and “isFraud”=0 : 99.87%

From analysing correlation-heatmap I realize that There is high correlation between oldbalanceOrig and newbalanceOrg.
Same as newbalanceDest and oldbalanceDest.

Due to multicollinearity, I remove these 2 features from dataset but after removing model accuracy decrease. So, I add those features back in my dataset. 

There are so missing values (0) in oldbalanceOrig ,newbalanceorg ,oldbalanceDest and newbalanceDest with calculation error.

To overcome highly imbalanced data, I use SMOTE (Over Sampling) technique.

When I try to Normalization and standardization of features, it decreased all type of model accuracy so I avoid to use it.
